# House Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning techniques. The primary focus is on developing a model to accurately predict house prices based on given features.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

```
|- house_price_prediction
    |- data
    |- notebooks
    |- src
    |- README.md
    |- requirements.txt
```

- `notebooks`: Contains Jupyter notebooks, including the main `prices.ipynb` notebook.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists project dependencies.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/house_price_prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd house_price_prediction
   ```

3. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   .\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   ```

5. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Run the Jupyter notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/prices.ipynb
   ```

## Project Components

### `notebooks/prices.ipynb`
- Main Jupyter notebook for exploring, analyzing, and predicting house prices.
